this doc is a direct uploading of my own keybindings.json.
so you shall note that the last 2 {}s is not necessary and will cause Tab UNFUNCTIONAL to confirm the suggestions.
Tab and Shift+Tab are used to switch between suggestions in this .json.
p.s. Shift+Esc can be used to Exit the suggestions table in default setting.
